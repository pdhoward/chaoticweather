ChaoticBot is a demonstration of the speed and agility that can be gained through the open source Community.

It is a hack of the IBM open source weather bot project, and draws on the code, patterns and integration for leveraging the Watson APIs

## IBM Weather Bot Installation

This is a Starter Kit (SK), which is designed to get you up and running quickly with a common industry pattern, and to provide information and best practices around Watson services and bots. This application demonstrates how the Conversation service can be used with different bot kits such as those from Facebook and Twilio to enable users to have an intuitive and natural conversation with the bots. This use case for this starter kit is around discussing the weather. The starter kit uses the WeatherInsights service to gather weather data and provide forecasts.

A running instance of the application in this Starter Kit is available as a [demo](https://text-bot.mybluemix.net). The demo does not include Facebook or Twilio integration. Running the application using the Facebook and Twilio bots requires credentials to access their services. For information about obtaining credentials and integrating Twilio and Facebook bots, see [Installing the bots](#bot-installation).

## Getting Started

This application is written in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and uses the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), the Node Package Manager, command to install a software development kit (SDK) for the Watson Developer Cloud services, as well as to satisfy other dependencies. The following instructions include Instructions for downloading and installing these.

1. Log into GitHub and clone [the repository for this application](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/text-bot). Change to the folder that contains your clone of this repository.

2. [Create a Bluemix Account](sign_up) if you do not already have one, or use an existing account.

3. If it is not already installed on your system, download and install the [Cloud-foundry command-line interface (CLI)][cloud_foundry] tool.

4. If it is not already installed on your system, install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Installing Node.js will also install the `npm` command. Make sure to use node version 4.2.1 or later, as specified in `package.json`, or you may run into problems when installing other mandatory Node.js packages.

5. <a name="edityml">Edit the `manifest.yml` file</a> in the folder that contains your clone of the repository and replace `application-name` with a unique name for your copy of the application. The name that you specify determines the application's URL, such as `application-name.mybluemix.net`. The relevant portion of the `manifest.yml` file looks like the following:

        declared-services:
        conversation-service:
          label: conversation
          plan: free
        weatherinsights-service:
          label: weatherinsights
          plan: Free-v2
        cloudantNoSQLDB-service:
          label: cloudantNoSQLDB
          plan: Shared
        applications:
          - services:
            - conversation-service
            - weatherinsights-service
            - cloudantNoSQLDB-service
          name: weather-conversation-bot
          command: npm start
          path: .
          memory: 512M

6. Connect to Bluemix by running the following commands in a terminal window:

     ```bash
     cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
     cf login -u <your-Bluemix-ID> -p <your-Bluemix-password>
     ```

7. Create instances of the services that are used by the application. If you already have instances of the Alchemy Language service, you can use that instances and its API key:

     - Create an instance of the [Conversation][conversation] service by running the following command:

        cf create-service conversation free conversation-service

    - If you do not already have one, create an instance of the [Alchemy Language](alchemy-language) service by running the following command:

        cf create-service alchemy_api free alchemy-language-service

        **IMPORTANT:** This application performs best when you use an Alchemy API key that supports high transaction limits. The free Alchemy API key has a limit of 1000 transactions per day.  You can upgrade to the Standard or Advanced Plan of the Alchemy API service to obtain a key that supports more than 1000 transactions per day. To upgrade to the Standard or Advanced plans, you will need to add a credit card to your Bluemix account. For plan and pricing information, click [here](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/alchemyapi/).

    - Create an instance of the [Weather Insights service](weatherinsights) by running the following command:

        cf create-service weatherinsights Free-v2 weatherinsights-service

    - Create an instance of the [Cloudant NoSQL database](cloudantNoSQLDB) service by running the following command:

        cf create-service cloudantNoSQLDB Shared cloudantNoSQLDB-service

    You will see a message which warns you that the **Shared** plan for the Cloudant NoSQLDB service is not free.

8. Create and retrieve service keys to access the Conversation service:

        cf create-service-key conversation-service myKey
        cf service-key conversation-service myKey

9. Create and retrieve service keys to access the WeatherInsights service:

        cf create-service-key weatherinsights-service myKey
        cf service-key weatherinsights-service myKey

    **IMPORTANT:** The Free plan for the WeatherInsights service provides a username and password as part of its service key. To take advantage of the full capabilities of the application in this starter kit, you should use an instance of the WeatherInsights service that supports high transaction limits. To be able to reach those limits, you will need to upgrade to the service's Standard or Premium plans because the pricing model for this service is based on the maximum number of API calls that you can make to the service per minute. The Premium plan is ideal. If you upgrade to the Standard or Premium plans, you will receive and API key rather than username and password credentials. To upgrade to the Standard or Premium plans, you will need to add a credit card to your Bluemix account. For plan and pricing information, click [here](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/weather-company-data/).

10. Create and retrieve service keys for the Alchemy Language service:

        cf create-service-key alchemy-language-service myKey
        cf service-key alchemy-language-service myKey

11. Create and retrieve service keys for the Cloudant service:

        cf create-service-key cloudantNoSQLDB-service myKey
        cf service-key cloudantNoSQLDB-service myKey

12. A file named `.env` file is used to provide the service keys for your service instances to the application. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your clone of the project repository by copying the sample `.env.example` file using the following command:

        cp .env.example .env

    The `.env` file will look something like the following:

        USE_WEBUI=true
        ALCHEMY_API_KEY=

        #CONVERSATION
        CONVERSATION_URL=https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/conversation/api
        CONVERSATION_USERNAME=
        CONVERSATION_PASSWORD=
        WORKSPACE_ID=

        #WEATHER
        WEATHER_URL=
        WEATHER_USERNAME=
        WEATHER_PASSWORD=

        #CLOUDANT
        CLOUDANT_URL=


13. The Conversation service must be trained before you can successfully use this application. The training data is provided in the file `resources/conversation-training-data.json` in your checkout of the repository. To train the model used by the Conversation service for this SK, do the following:

    1. Login to Bluemix

    2. Select **Dashboard** from the page heading

    3. Select the instance of the Conversation service that you are using

    4. Scroll down (if necessary) and click **Launch tool**. (You may be asked to log in again.)

    5. Click **Choose a file**, navigate to the `resources` directory of your clone of the repository for this project, and select the file `conversation-training-data.json`


    6. Click **Import** to upload the `.json` file, creates a workspace, and trains the model used by the Conversation service.

    To find your workspace ID once training has completed, click the three vertical dots in the upper right-hand corner of the Workspace pane, and select **View details**.

14. Push the updated application live by running the following command:

    cf push

    or by pressing the following "Deploy to Bluemix" button:

    [![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/text-bot.git)

## Installing the bots

1. Edit the `.env` file to add credentials for Facebook and Twilio. See the following links for information about where you can get the credentials required by the botkit for each service:

    * [Facebook](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/readme-facebook.md#getting-started)
    * [Twilio](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/readme-twilioipm.md#getting-started)

2. If you are integrating with Twilio, set the `USE_TWILIO` and `USE_TWILIO_SMS` variables in your `.env` file to `true`. If you are integrating with Facebook, set the `USE_FACEBOOK` variable in your `.env` file to `true`.

3. Modify the file `lib/bot/bot.js` to include your own bot handling code. If you would like to use a separate bot messaging service (such as `wit.ai`, `converse.ai`, and so on ), you can add the middleware to each bot instance that you'd like for that service to use, and configure it with the single `bot.js` file.

## About the Weather Conversation pattern

This Starter Kit uses weather information from the WeatherInsights service to demonstrate how to integrate a bot with the Conversation service available on Bluemix. It provides extension points for integration botkits from vendors such as Facebook and Twilio.

For a given input *(e.g. question about weather in Austin, TX)* , a trained Conversation service instance responds with weather forecast. The service is composed of a model trained with a set of intents and entities (in this case, the intent is to get the forecast and the entities are cities that the user might want to know the forecast for). The dialog agent of the Conversation service is responsible for interacting with the user and keeping track of the context of the conversation so that it can provide answers to follow up questions about the same topic.

## Running locally
First, make sure that you followed steps 1 through 11 in the [Getting Started](#Getting Started) and that you are still logged in to Bluemix.

1. Make sure you have created the Alchemy Language, Conversation, Cloudant, and WeatherInsights services and updated the credentials information for those services in your `.env` file, as explained in the previous section.

2. Execute the following command to pick up the environment specified for your application based on its name in your `manifest.yml` file:

        cf env <application-name>

2. Install any dependencies that a local version of your application requires:

        npm install

    **Note** If you run into problems during installation, you might want to update your node version. Get version 4.4.7 or above.

4. Open `http://localhost:5000` to see the running application.

## Adapting/Extending the Starter Kit

The following image provides a general overview of how botkits from external services can interact with Watson services.

<a>
# Architecture Diagram
</a>

![](readme_images/TextBot-ArchitectureFlow.jpg)

This Starter Kit uses  weather data from the WeatherInsights service and can easily be extended to integrate with botkits from vendors such as Facebook and Twilio. However, the concepts used here are platform independent and can be applied to a use cases other than providing forecasts. To do so, define your use case in the Conversation service, configuring your Conversation by using the tool provided on the dashboard page for your instance of the Conversation service. You can also integrate other bots as mentioned on the [Installing the bots](#bot-installation) section.

## Best Practices

Most of the best practices associated with writing a conversational application are explained within the [documentation for the Conversation service](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/). These can be grouped into several general areas, as described in the next few sections.

### Intents
  * When defining intents, follow naming conventions to create consistent intents.
  * Use "-" to separate multiple levels (Example : location-weather-forecast)
  * Use "_" to separate multiple word intents (Example : business_center)
  * Provide more variations of input via examples for each intent. The more variations the better.
  * Avoid overlapping intents across examples. (Example : benefits_eligibility and benefits_elgibility_employee). To avoid this, group examples into a single intent and use entities to deal with subtle variations.
  * Examples for intents should be representative of end user input

### Entities
  * Use entities from within the conversation tooling when dealing with a concise and well-defined set of entities (Example : days of the week). Refer to [Entities](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/entity_ovw.shtml) section within the Watson Conversation Service documentation.
  * Use synonyms to capture variations of the entity. This may include acronyms, abbreviations, multi-word variations.
  * Use Alchemy Entity Extraction API to provide a more open set of entities (Examples : City names). For a more advanced cases or special domains, it may be necessary to create a custom model which is beyond the scope of this starter kit.

### Dialog
  * Use context variables to maintain state or pass information between your bot and the application. Refer to [Context variables](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/advanced_overview.shtml#advanced_context) section within the Watson Conversation Service Documentation.

### General
  * Use the Bot controller (controller.js) to maintain calls to external APIs such as Weather, Stocks or to enterprise systems such as HR, Payroll or CRM systems.
